I was the lone TA for [this class][1]. I reworked many HW problems and made the solutions. I also gave a replacement [lecture][2].

Classical Molecular Dynamics of Lennard-Jones Fluid
======
- statistical analysis: auto-correlation and standard error

- correlation functions: g(r), S(k), v(t)v(0)

Classical Monte Carlo of Lennard-Jones Fluid
======
- detailed balance
- force-biased Monte Carlo

Classical Monte Carlo of 2D Ising Model
======
- heat bath algorithm
- cluster moves
