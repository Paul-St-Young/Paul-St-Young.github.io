title: "Electronic band gaps from Quantum Monte Carlo methods"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'We prove the leading-order scaling of the fundamental gap based on the asymptotic behavior of changes in the electronic structure factor S(k) in the long wavelength limit (k=0). We further directly calculate finite-size correction to leading and sub-leading orders using only S(k) at one system size.'

We develop a method for calculating the fundamental electronic gap of semiconductors and insulators using grand canonical Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We discuss the origin of the bias introduced by supercell calculations of finite size and show how to correct the leading and subleading finite size errors either based on observables accessible in the finite-sized simulations or from DFT calculations. Our procedure is applied to solid molecular hydrogen and compared to experiment for carbon and silicon crystals.
