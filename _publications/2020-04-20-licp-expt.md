excerpt: 'We facilitated the first unambigous direct observation of the renormalization factor Zkf in lithium by using QMC to validate and correct experimental Compton profile near the Fermi break, where severe smearing from resolution and final state effects denied definitive observation of the momentum discontinuity in previous studies.'

We have measured the momentum distribution and renormalization factor ZkF in liquid and solid lithium by high-resolution Compton scattering. High-resolution data over a wide momentum range exhibit a clear feature of the renormalization and a sharp drop of momentum densities at the Fermi momentum kF. These results are compared with those computed by quantum Monte Carlo simulation performed both on a disordered crystal and a liquid exhibiting very good agreement. Asymptotic behavior of the experimental and theoretical momentum distributions are examined to estimate ZkF. The experimentally obtained ZkF=0.43+0.11−0.01 for liquid Li and 0.54+0.11−0.02 for solid Li are in good agreement with theoretical results of 0.54±0.01 and 0.64±0.01, respectively.
