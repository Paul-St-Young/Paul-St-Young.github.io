I was the lone TA for [this class][1]. I reworked many HW problems and made the solutions. We covered most materials in "The Oxford Solid State Basics" by Steven Simon.

Simple models to explain transport
======
- Einstein model specific heat
- Debye model specific heat
- Drude conductivity
- Sommerfeld conductivity

Crystal structure
======
- Direct and reciprocal lattice
- X-ray and neutron diffraction

Tight binding
======
- 1D chain
- Kronig-Penny model
- Nearly-free electron model

Magnetism
======
- Spin-orbit coupling and Hund's rule
- 1D Ising transfer matrix
- Crystallite domains
