title: "Quantum Monte Carlo Compton profiles of solid and liquid lithium"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'We calculated the momentum distribution n(k) of BCC lithium using all-electron QMC in the grand-canonical ensemble. Kinetic sum rule from finite-size corrected n(k) agrees with thermodynamic limit to 0.1 mha/e. BFD solid - liquid difference agrees well with experiment, but the pseudopotential Compton profile is too narrow due to lack of orthogonalization with core states.'

We computed the Compton profile of solid and liquid lithium using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and compared with recent experimental measurements obtaining good agreement. Importantly, we find it crucial to account for proper core-valence orthogonalization and to address density differences when comparing with experiment. To account for disorder effects, we sampled finite-temperature configurations using molecular dynamics (MD), then performed diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) simulations on each configuration. We used Slater-Jastrow wavefunctions and grand-canonical twist-averaged boundary conditions. A QMC pseudopotential correction, derived from an all-electron DMC simulation of the perfect crystal was also used. Our calculations provide the first all-electron QMC benchmark for the Compton profile of lithium crystal and pseudopotential-corrected QMC Compton profiles for both the liquid and solid.
