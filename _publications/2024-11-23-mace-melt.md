We present results and discuss methods for computing the melting temperature of dense molecular hydrogen using a machine learned model trained on quantum Monte Carlo data. In this newly trained model, we emphasize the importance of accurate total energies in the training. We integrate a two phase method for estimating the melting temperature with estimates from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation to provide a more accurate melting curve from the model. We make detailed predictions of the melting temperature, solid and liquid volumes, latent heat and internal energy from 50 GPa to 180 GPa for both classical hydrogen and quantum hydrogen. At pressures of roughly 173 GPa and 1635K, we observe molecular dissociation in the liquid phase. We compare with previous simulations and experimental measurements.
